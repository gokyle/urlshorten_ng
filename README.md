# urlshorten
## a urlshortening web service in Go

## Setting Up

The `setup/setup` tool should be used to initialise the database. The database
file defaults to `data/urlshorten.db`. This may be changed in the configuration
file, but the file has to be specified on the command line for the setup tool.

The database should be initialised with `setup -d /path/to/db/file -c` to create
the database. The `-a` flag adds a user to the database, and `-r` removes the
user. The `setup` program will prompt for the user name, and, where applicable,
the password. Note that while the program will create the database file as
needed, it will not create intermediary directories.


## The Configuration File

Configuration is done with the [`goconfig`](https://gokyle.github.com/goconfig)
package. The configuration file consists of two sections: `server` and `page`.

### `server`
This section configures the server. It supports the following options:

* `port`: set the port the server should listen on. Defaults to `8080`.
* `host`: set the host the host the server should listen on. This is
separate from the `page` option with this name. Defaults to an empty string
to listen on all interfaces.
* `authenticate`: if set to "false", turns off checks for authentication. This
is on by default.
* `admin_user`: set the administrative user; this is used to add new users to
the site. The default is not set; no users can be added via the site.
* `development`: set this to `false` to disable development features; in
development mode, links are set up as `host:port`. Links in development
mode also use the `http` scheme. If development mode is turned off, links
use `https` and the port is not included in links. Defaults to `true`.
* `dbfile`: specify the path to the database file. Defaults to
`data/urlshorten.db`.

### `page`
This section controls page templates. Valid options are:

* `title`: sets the page title. Defaults to `urlshorten.go`.
* `host`: the host name to use in links. Defaults to `localhost`. This
affects displayed links to shortcodes only.

### Example production configuration file:

```
[server]
port = 8100
host = 127.0.0.1
development = false
admin_user = flynn

[page]
title = nodality.io
host = nodality.io
```

This will set up a server that listens on `127.0.0.1:8080` in production
mode; pages will have an title of `"nodality.io"` and links will point to
`https://nodality.io`. The user `flynn` can add new users via the web
interface.

## Running The Service

It is recommended to run the service behind a proxy; in nginx, you could do
this with

```
upstream goweb {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080;
} 

server {
	listen 80;
	server_name example.net;
	rewrite ^(.*) https://$host$1 permanent;
}

server {
	listen 443 ;
	server_name example.net

	access_log /var/log/nginx/example_access.log;
	error_log /var/log/nginx/example_error.log;
	location / {
		proxy_pass http://goweb;
	}

        ssl on;
	ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/example.pem;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/example.key;

	ssl_session_timeout 5m;

	ssl_protocols TLSv1;
	ssl_ciphers ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:!MEDIUM:!LOW:+SSLv3:+EXP;
	ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

}
```

In this case, nginx handles all the TLS aspects and proxies incoming requests.

Then, navigate to `https://example.net/`. Your passwords may be changed with
`https://example.net/change`. You can add a new user at
`https://example.net/add`.
